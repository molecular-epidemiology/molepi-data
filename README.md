# molepi-data

This repository comprises of datasets for who infected whom, based on pathogen sequence data and/or classical epidemiological data.

The aim is to make it easier to apply methods for who infected whom on different datasets, as well as to help ensure that when a given dataset is analysed, that any differences in results are not confounded by factors such as different pipelines for processing NGS data, sequence alignment, etc..

Given the limitations of storing large files on GitHub, this repository contains relatively small datasets - where high-throughput sequencing has been used, I have just included the assembled nucleotide sequence. The raw data for such studies will be distributed via [http://github.com/molecular-epidemiology/molepi-ngs-data](http://github.com/molecular-epidemiology/molepi-ngs-data).
