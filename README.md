# molepi-data

This repository comprises of datasets for who infected whom, based on pathogen sequence data and/or classical epidemiological data. The aim is to make it easier to apply methods for who infected whom on different datasets, as well as to help ensure that when a given dataset is analysed, that any differences in results are not confounded by factors such as different pipelines for processing NGS data, sequence alignment, etc..
